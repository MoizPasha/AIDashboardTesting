# ðŸ§  Input Validation â€“ Feature Branch

This feature branch introduces **Intent Detection** to the AI Dashboard using [`node-nlp`](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js). It enables the app to intelligently determine whether a user prompt is requesting a chart or not, helping avoid irrelevant or unsupported inputs, saving API call costs.

---
## ðŸ“¦ Based On

This project is based on [AI-Dash-testing](https://github.com/ABNmmd/AI-Dash-testing), created by [@ABNmmd](https://github.com/ABNmmd).

This fork extends the original dashboard by adding an NLP-based intent classifier to filter and handle prompt commands intelligently.
---
## ðŸš€ What This Feature Does

- Detects whether the user wants to **generate a chart** or not.
- Prevents unintended chart generation attempts by checking the user's intent.
- Alerts users to rephrase their prompt if intent confidence is too low.
- NLP model is trained once and reused via API calls (Next.js serverless route).

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. A small NLP model is trained using predefined chart-related and non-chart phrases.
2. The model is saved to `src/models/intentmodel.nlp`.
3. A Next.js API route (`/api/classify-intent`) receives the prompt, uses `node-nlp` to detect intent, and returns the top intent and confidence score.
4. The frontend calls this API and only proceeds with chart generation if:
   - The intent is `"chart_command"`, and
   - The confidence score is at least `0.3`.
